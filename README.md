using shell script combined with cli-based network packet analysis tool tshark 
filters for extracting of packet artifacts such as IP Addresses, domain names
and many more. This tool intends to analyze multiple packet captures in a 
single  execution without looking at the Graphical Interface tool like wireshark.
